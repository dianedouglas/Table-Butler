Table-Butler
============

By Diane Douglas and Lee Kebler

Similarly to ActiveRecord, this is a base class for sub-classes which have corresponding tables in a PSQL database. 

When a class inherits from the Table Butler, it will automatically have methods for saving, deleting, comparing, and reading out a list of all saved instances of the subclass.
